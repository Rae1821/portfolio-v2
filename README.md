Portfolio v2 using TailwindCSS

- This is my portfolio site which features a little about me, some of my favorite projects, and a contact section with a contact form.

- I built and designed this site using TailwindCSS. It was my first time using TailwindCSS and I loved working with it! I hope to use it on another project again in the futre.

- Each project has it's own page with more in depth information about the project.

- Created the contact form using FormSpree.

- You can check out the live site at ✨ www.rachelandersondooley.com ✨
